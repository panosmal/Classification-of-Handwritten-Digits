# Handwritten digit recognition with SVD

In this project we construct an algorithm for classification of handwritten digits. 
Using a training set, and compute the SVD of each class matrix and we use the first 
few (5-20) singular vectors as basis to classify unknown test digits according to how 
well they can be represented in terms of the respective bases. 

The project consists of a pdf file that the implementation details and a Jupyter 
notebook with all the code and outputs.
