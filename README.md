# Handwritten digit recognition with SVD

In this project we construct an algorithm for classification of handwritten digits. 
Using a training set, we calculate the SVD analysis of each class matrix and use the first 
few (5-20) singular vectors as basis to classify unknown test digits, according to how 
well they can be represented in terms of the respective bases. 

The project consists of a pdf file with implementation details and a Jupyter 
notebook with all the code and outputs.
